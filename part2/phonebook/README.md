# 2.6: The Phonebook Step1

Let's create a simple phonebook. In this part, we will only be adding names to the phonebook.

Let us start by implementing the addition of a person to the phonebook.

You can use the code below as a starting point for the App component of your application:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

const App = () => {
  const [persons, setPersons] = useState([
    { name: 'Arto Hellas' }
  ]) 
  const [newName, setNewName] = useState('')

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Phonebook</h2>
      <form>
        <div>
          name: <input />
        </div>
        <div>
          <button type="submit">add</button>
        </div>
      </form>
      <h2>Numbers</h2>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
