# 1.3: course information step3
Let's move forward to using objects in our application. Modify the variable definitions of the App component as follows and also refactor the application so that it still works:
```jsx
const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const part1 = {
    name: 'Fundamentals of React',
    exercises: 10
  }
  const part2 = {
    name: 'Using props to pass data',
    exercises: 7
  }
  const part3 = {
    name: 'State of a component',
    exercises: 14
  }

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

# 1.4: course information step4
And then place the objects into an array. Modify the variable definitions of App into the following form and modify the other parts of the application accordingly:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const parts = [
    {
      name: 'Fundamentals of React',
      exercises: 10
    },
    {
      name: 'Using props to pass data',
      exercises: 7
    },
    {
      name: 'State of a component',
      exercises: 14
    }
  ]

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```
# 1.5: course information step5
Let's take the changes one step further. Change the course and its parts into a single JavaScript object. Fix everything that breaks.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const course = {
    name: 'Half Stack application development',
    parts: [
      {
        name: 'Fundamentals of React',
        exercises: 10
      },
      {
        name: 'Using props to pass data',
        exercises: 7
      },
      {
        name: 'State of a component',
        exercises: 14
      }
    ]
  }

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```
